## About Peugeot

Peugeot is one of the oldest automobile manufacturers in the world, with a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. The company started as a family business manufacturing coffee mills and bicycles before evolving into a major global automobile manufacturer.

## Generations

Peugeot's evolution can be broadly categorized into several key periods:

- **Early Years (1810-1889)**: Founded in 1810 by Jean-Pierre and Jean-Frédéric Peugeot, the company initially produced coffee mills, tools, and eventually bicycles. The iconic lion logo was adopted in 1847.

- **Pioneer Automotive Era (1889-1929)**: Peugeot entered automobile production in 1889 with the steam-powered Serpollet-Peugeot, followed by an internal combustion model in 1890. By the early 20th century, Peugeot had established itself as a major European automaker with models like the Bébé compact car.

- **Mid-Century Expansion (1930-1975)**: This period saw significant growth with iconic models like the 201, 202, 203, and 404. The 404, introduced in 1960, became famous for its reliability and was produced until 1975. The 1960s also saw the introduction of the popular 204 and 504 models.

- **Modern Era (1976-1999)**: Peugeot merged with Citroën in 1976 to form PSA Peugeot Citroën. This era brought innovative models like the 205 (which revitalized the company in the 1980s), 306, and 406, as Peugeot established itself as a producer of stylish, practical vehicles.

- **Contemporary Period (2000-2020)**: Characterized by international expansion, design evolution, and a broader range of vehicles including crossovers and SUVs like the 3008 and 5008. This period also saw increasing focus on environmental technologies.

- **Stellantis Era (2021-present)**: In January 2021, PSA Group merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to form Stellantis, creating the world's fourth-largest automaker. Under this new structure, Peugeot continues to develop innovative vehicles with emphasis on electrification and mobility solutions.
